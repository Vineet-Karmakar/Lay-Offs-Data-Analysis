# Lay-offs-Data-Analysis

In this project, I have looked at a dataset containing lay-off data of various companies. A lot of interesting insights can be derived from the dataset.

The project is divided into two parts.
1. Initially, I have cleaned the raw data to convert it to a suitable format for Exploratory Data Analysis. The queries used for data cleaning have been uploaded in this repository.
2. I have then performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the clean data to derive certain insights regarding trends and patterns in the data.
